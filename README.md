# **trust-database-app**

**trust-database-app** is an app designed to help charitable organisations gather and filter information about grant-making trusts, so that they can apply for funding in the right places. 

Information about the thousands of grant-making trusts based in the UK is publically available on the Charity Commission website; however, this information is not easy to filter, collate or cross-reference.

This app allows a user to gather the information available from the Charity Commission into a single space, which can then be searched through, with reference to related criteria.
